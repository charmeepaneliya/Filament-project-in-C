📘 String Programs in C

This repository contains two beginner-friendly C programs for string handling, implemented without using any built-in string functions. Both programs use simple loops for their operations.

✔️ Program 1: Palindrome Checker





Description

This program checks whether a given string is a palindrome, meaning it reads the same forwards and backwards.

Features

Accepts a string input from the user

Compares characters manually using loops

Determines if the string is a palindrome

No string library functions are used

Example Output

<img width="919" height="910" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-11 161619" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3e099869-e524-452d-84c1-efe081a19e39" />

✔️ Program 2: Character Frequency Counter




Description

This program counts the frequency of each character in a given string. Characters already counted are skipped to avoid duplicate output.

Features

Accepts a string input from the user

Uses loops to count the frequency of each character

Ignores repeated characters in output

No string library functions are used

Example Output

<img width="1023" height="918" alt="Screenshot 2025-12-11 161612" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e8d14c7c-c3b4-4781-b7bb-af3565c85545" />



🎯 Purpose

These programs are intended for:

Beginners learning C programming
